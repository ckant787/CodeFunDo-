During elections we can put cameras in front of pooling booth so that we can recognize any harmful things like knife, gun etc. using machine Leraning module OpenCV.
We can also make the machines more secure by using Obeject-Oriented Programming so that nobody can change anything after the votes are casted by persons.
We can make the counting process faster using Algorithms And Data structures in C++.
